## **Background**
Energy access organizations do a lot of surveys to understand the potential customers, sites, and marketplaces. They often struggle to find platforms that can help in managing the data collected through different surveys. There is an initial question of what data platform to use, and later questions of: how to train staff on a given platform; how to integrate the platform into everyday operations and systems.How to ensure that the platform is kept up to date. We’ve noticed teams try out a tool or method for a few weeks or months before running into some kind of snag: pencil and paper surveys are hard to scale; a handful of apps are just short of perfect, and custom or enterprise-grade platforms can be costly.

While well-funded companies might contract 3rd party service providers to create both market and business intelligence on their behalf, early-stage companies usually can’t afford it. This leads to young organizations to build internal capacity for surveying the communities that they will be serving. 

The Survey Toolkit, created by Devergy based on their own experience and challenges faced, provides a simple approach to collecting, analyzing, and presenting field survey data.
